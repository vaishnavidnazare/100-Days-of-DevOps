Q. To install nad configure nginx as a loadbalancer
ANS: 
    1. we need to see on which ports the app servers are listening and use that ports in the load balancer config.
    2. The following changes need to made in the nginx.conf file after install nginx.

        `   worker_processes 1;

            events {
                worker_connections 1024;
            }

            http {
                upstream app_servers {
                    server 192.168.1.11:80;
                    server 192.168.1.12:80;
                    server 192.168.1.13:80;
                }

                server {
                    listen 80;

                    location / {
                        proxy_pass http://app_servers;
                        proxy_set_header Host $host;
                        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
                    }
                }
            }
            `

    3. the IPs and port must be changed accordingly.

Q. Curl the apache service from jum_host and check why is it not working?
Ans: 
    1. `ssh tony@stapp01`
    2. `sudo systemctl status httpd`
        apache service not working, address already in use 
    3. Identify which service is using the port 
        `sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 8085` - sendmail was that service
    4. `sudo systemctl stop sendmail`
    5. `sudo systemctl disable sendmail`
    6. `sudo systemctl start httpd`
    7. now the curl command wil work 
        `curl http://stapp01:8085`

Q. The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries is working on developing some bash scripts to automate different day to day tasks. One is to create a bash script for taking websites backup. They have a static website running on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter, and they need to create a bash script named official_backup.sh which should accomplish the following tasks. (Also remember to place the script under /scripts directory on App Server 2).


a. Create a zip archive named xfusioncorp_official.zip of /var/www/html/official directory.


b. Save the archive in /backup/ on App Server 2. This is a temporary storage, as backups from this location will be clean on weekly basis. Therefore, we also need to save this backup archive on Nautilus Backup Server.


c. Copy the created archive to Nautilus Backup Server server in /backup/ location.


d. Please make sure script won't ask for password while copying the archive file. Additionally, the respective server user (for example, tony in case of App Server 1) must be able to run it.


e. Do not use sudo inside the script.

Note:
The zip package must be installed on given App Server before executing the script. This package is essential for creating the zip archive of the website files. Install it manually outside the script.


ANS: 

1. install zip 
    - `sudo yum install zip`
2. create ssh key 
    - `ssh-keygen -t rsa`
    - `ssh-copy-id user@server`
3. Enter the /scripts directory and then create the script file as follows
    -   #!/bin/bash

        # Variables
        SRC_DIR="/var/www/html/ecommerce"
        TMP_BACKUP="/backup"
        BACKUP_NAME="xfusioncorp_ecommerce.zip"
        DEST_USER="natasha"        # Replace with the correct backup server user
        DEST_SERVER="172.16.238.16" # Replace with the Backup Server IP/hostname
        DEST_DIR="/backup"

        # Create backup directory if not exists
        mkdir -p ${TMP_BACKUP}

        # Create zip archive
        zip -r ${TMP_BACKUP}/${BACKUP_NAME} ${SRC_DIR}

        # Copy to Nautilus Backup Server
        scp ${TMP_BACKUP}/${BACKUP_NAME} ${DEST_USER}@${DEST_SERVER}:${DEST_DIR}/

4. make the file executable 
    - chmod +x script.sh

5. Run the file 
    - ./script.sh
